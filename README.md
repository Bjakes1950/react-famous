# react-famous


Add [Famo.us](http://famo.us) interactions and animations to any [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) application and build **Famo.us** applications with **React**.

Using `react-famous`, you can:

* Create **Famo.us** apps using familiar **React** component specs and lifecycle.
* Bring rich **Famo.us** animations to new or existing **React** apps.
* Easily integrate **Famo.us** and **React** apps.

`react-famous` is similar to [famous-angular](https://github.com/Famous/famous-angular) for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [famous-views](http://famous-views.meteor.com/) for [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).
